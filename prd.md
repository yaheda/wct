  company: ['/about', '/company', '/', '/home'],
  
  autoDetect: async (domain) => {
    const commonPaths = Object.values(saasPageDetection).flat();
    const foundPages = [];
    
    for (const path of commonPaths) {
      const url = `${domain}${path}`;
      const response = await testUrl(url);
      if (response.status === 200) {
        foundPages.push({
          url,
          type: getPageType(path),

    /(\d+(?:,\d{3})*(?:\.\d{2})?)\s*dollars?\s*\/?\s*(mo|month|yr|year)?/gi,
    /(free|trial|demo)/gi
  ],

  }
};
```
