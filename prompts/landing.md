Use the ShadCN MCP server to bring in necessary components to build a SaaS landing page for an Ai-Driven website called Website Change Alert

The design should be fully fluid.

Integrate a navebar with a logo on the left, a primary nave in the middle with 3 links, and a navbar CTP buttons on the right that says "Join up" and "Login".
The Join up should be emphasized with the primary color, login secondary.

The hero section should span 100vh, a feature a large headline that is aligned top of the design with good white space away from the browser edges.
The headline should say "Simple Website Change Alert, Finally" with a CTA button to "Join waiting list".
The background of this hero section will eventually an interactive background element, designate a div that sits behind everything for this purpose and label it as such.
